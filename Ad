Hacker weekend

Have you had the urge to just sit down and code, code, code 48 straight hours of awesomeness? Yes? 

Now you have the opportunity to join the Team Singularity Robotics Project - TSRP! 
During the weekend in mid April, we have arranged a place to contribute significantly to this project. 
TSRP is aiming to open-source the software for a robotics investigation platform. Current aims are:

* Intefrace the computer (Raspberry Pi) wirelessly (We don't want any cables, duh).
* Create a mobile platform, move in any direction! 
* Stick a webcam to it! Yes, eyes, eyes, spies everywhere!
* Add servo control for a pan/tilt cam - Of course we like to move it, move it. 
* Have ALL the sensors in the world! Stream and select information from the 4 sensors: accelerometer, magnetometer (can be used as compas?), gyro, pressure - today, the weather will be bad. It's up to us to see how to use them - pretty graphs, pretty graphs everywhere!
* Add an awesome web-based interface! Control everything from everywhere! Bulgaria, UK, or Jamaica, doesn't matter, controled it.
* Interface an Anolog-to-Digital-Converter - put some range finding, temperature ... anything else? 
* Create a charging station - our robot must have food too!
* Put some speakers/microphone, telepresense here we come.
* Adjustable headlights? 
* Make our robot social - let it post his thoughts in his blog - "Bzzz it's chilly today, only 15'C, I'll go and charge myself!" :D
* Advanced projects: SLAM, 3D image mapping (just like google street view)
* Your idea?
* Your neighbours idea?

We are aiming at solving the maximum amount of challenges we can. 

Current stage can be found here: https://github.com/23pointsNorth/tsrp.git

To participate:
* Knowledge in C/C++ required. Bonus if experience in embedded programming, php, git, networking, unix, ROS, OpenCV..
* VM machine + 16GB free space 
* Git account: https://github.com/

For more information contact Daniel Angelov.

It will be an extremely good opportunity for thinking outside the box, creating new and cutting-edge stuff. At the end of the day, there are officially < 30 robotics platform using ROS. We can establish the next!

If you are outside BG/occupied at that time, no worries, you can still join for an unlimited amount of time! This is where open sourcing comes into play - fork our repository, work in your free time.
